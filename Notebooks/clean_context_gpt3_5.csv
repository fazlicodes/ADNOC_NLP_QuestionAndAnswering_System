The rig supervisor for this operation is Leroy Swearingen, along with Bob Frank and Duane Winkler. Our current task is to remove the cement head and prepare to cut off the conductor. The elevation for this task is 5415.1 and the drill floor square measures 2.0. The measured depth is not available at the moment.

Our planned activities for this phase include cutting off the conductor and surface casing. We will also weld the surface casing head and perform a NU BOP test on the BOPE from 06:00 to 13:30, which will take approximately 7.5 hours. This phase of the operation is categorized under surface drilling with the code ""Trips"". We will be tripping in the hole with a directional BHA and drill pipe, reaching the bottom at 1.629' without any fill. We will ensure that the bottom hole is clean and then circulate a small amount of cutting to recover and maintain a clean well bore.

Afterwards, we will trip out of the hole and stand in the derrick with the drill pipe and drill collars. We will lay down the VRSS BHA and hold a safety meeting from 13:30 to 14:30, which will last for 1.0 hour. This phase is categorized under surface casing with the code ""Other"". We will have a safety meeting with eight Wyoming Casing personnel, nine Frontier personnel, and the DSM.

Following the safety meeting, we will rig up the Wyoming Casing equipment from 14:30 to 18:00, which will take approximately 3.5 hours. This phase is categorized under surface casing with the code ""Run Csg & Cement"". Our operation during this phase involves running the surface casing with the specification of 13 3/8"" X 68 ppf, L80, BTC threads. We will run a float shoe, one joint of casing (shoe track), and 41 joints of 13 3/8"" casing, making a total of 42 joints of casing. The bottom of the float shoe will be at 1,629', which is also the bottom of the well. Additionally, we will use 14 centralizers and 1 cement basket.

From 18:00 to 19:30, we will proceed with conditioning mud and performing circulation operations. The goal is to establish circulation and circulate the well while rigging down the casing run equipment. We will then rig up the cement equipment on the rig floor from 19:30 to 20:00, and hold a safety meeting. We will lay down the CRT tool and rig up the cement head, establishing circulation.

Starting from 20:00 to 22:00, we will run the cementers, troubleshoot any computer recording problems that may arise. From 22:00 to 01:00, we will hold another safety meeting, test the pump and lines to 3000 psi, and perform the cementing process. This includes using 30 bbls of fresh water ahead, followed by 50 bbls of 10.5 ppg sepiolite pacer, 13 bbls of Sodium Silicate, and 5 bbls of fresh water. We will drop the bottom plug and then proceed with 410 bbls of 12.92 ppg RC Thermalite-HT Cement at 5 BPM. After dropping the top plug, we will displace with 237 bbls of fresh water, over-displacing by 3 bbls. The floats will be held in place. In total, we will use 212 bbls of cement, checking the annulus cement at the surface and rechecking it after 30 minutes to ensure it remains stable. Throughout the job, we expect good returns with no losses. Once completed, we will flush out the conductor riser with RD Cementers.

From 01:00 to 06:00, we will wait for the cement to cure and then center the casing in the bushing. We will rig down the flow line and clean the cellar."

Currently, the operation is focused on NUBOPE. We need to prepare for testing and arrange directional tools. The elevation is 5415.1 and the drill floor square is 4.0. The measured depth is not available.

The planned activities include testing the BOPE, using the MU directional BHA, drilling out the TIH, and performing a FIT test. This will be done from 06:00 to 18:00 for a total of 12.0 hours. This phase is known as Intermediate Drilling and the code is Nipple Up B.O.P.. Prior to starting the operation, a pre-job safety meeting (PJSM) will be conducted involving the FORGE DSM's and Frontier Drilling.

To begin, a new choke line and nipple need to be set up to the choke manifold and BOP stack. Additionally, the catwalk should be put in place and the pipe racks need to be set up. Furthermore, we should hang lights and perform general housekeeping tasks. The trip tank needs to be rigged up as well.

We will then proceed to unload three loads (80 joints) of 9 5/8"" 40# HCL80 casing onto the racks. This is done in preparation for drilling the intermediate section of the hole. This phase will take place from 18:00 to 06:00 for another 12.0 hours. The code remains Nipple Up B.O.P. and a pre-job safety meeting will once again be held.

During this time, we need to address a repair clamp on the grabber box from quill to mud-saver on top-drive. We should also service and change out filters and fluids as needed on the top drive and HPU. Additionally, we need to stage the directional tools on the rack and pick up a joint of drill pipe to put in the mouse hole for testing. We can then move the drill pipe to the finger racks to free up the pipe racks for additional casing that is en route. Lastly, a bolt on the annular needs to be fixed and general housekeeping should be maintained."

The current operation is to change the BHA to drill float equipment at an elevation of 5415.1 on the drill floor square of 5.0. The directional drilling is at 15. The measured depth is not available.

The planned activities include drilling the shoe track, tripping out of the hole, and picking up the rotary steerable BHA from 06:00 to 09:00 for a duration of 3.0 hours. This phase is classified as intermediate drilling with a code of Other. Prior to the operation, a pre-job safety meeting (PJSM) will be conducted with FORGE DSM's and Frontier Drilling.

During the operation, the drill pipe will be moved and sorted for drilling operations. Additionally, general housekeeping tasks such as picking up tools and emptying trash containers will be performed. This will take place from 09:00 to 16:00 for a duration of 7.0 hours. The phase for this activity is also intermediate, with a casing code of Test B.O.P. The operation during this phase is to rig up A-1 Testing and begin BOPE testing at 09:00.

Various tests will be conducted, including testing blinds to 250 psi low and 5,000 psi high, testing pipe rams to the same pressure levels, testing the choke manifold, choke lines, and all valves to the same pressure levels, and testing the mud lines back to pumps to 80% of the liner rating of 3,600 psi. Finally, the casing will be tested to 1,500 psi. All the tests were successful.

At 10:00, there will be a meeting with Jim Goddard from the Division of Water Rights, State of Utah. A tour of the rig and pad will be conducted, and the witness BOPE testing in progress. Required information, including a casing report, cement report, and BOPE charts and reports, will be reviewed.

From 16:00 to 17:00, there will be a 1.0-hour phase dedicated to intermediate casing with a code of Test B.O.P. During this time, Nabors will be installing a K Box Light, which is the control center for Nabors Rig Watch. Additionally, a wear bushing will be installed, and a function test will be performed on the accumulator as per procedures.

From 17:00 to 18:00, there will be a 1.0-hour phase for intermediate casing with a code of Cut off Drill Line. A safety meeting will be held, followed by the slip and cut of the drilling line. The top drive will be set in the shipping position, and the blocks will be chained off to the derrick. The preparation for slipping and cutting the drilling line continues, while Nabors works on the K Box Light.

From 18:00 to 23:00, there will be a 5.0-hour phase for intermediate casing with a code of Dir Work. Another pre-job safety meeting (PJSM) will be conducted with FORGE DSM's and Frontier Drilling. The intermediate directional tools BHA #2, equipped with a 12 1/4"" PDC bit, will be picked up.

From 23:00 to 00:30, there will be a 1.5-hour phase for intermediate casing with a code of Trips. The operation during this time is to trip in the hole with VRRS and tag cement.

From 00:30 to 03:30, there will be a 3.0-hour phase for intermediate casing with a code of Drilling. The operation during this phase is to drill cement and float collar, stop drilling, and prepare to pull out of the hole.

From 03:30 to 06:00, there will be a 2.5-hour phase for intermediate casing with a code of Trips. The operation during this time is to trip out of the hole (TOOH) with VRSS, with no issues with the bit.

In conclusion, it is probable that there will be a rubber interference. The plan forward is to trip in the hole with a mill tooth bit and drill up the float equipment."

The current operation is drilling ahead at an elevation of 5415.1 and the drill floor square is 6.0. The directional drilling is 16. The measured depth is not available. The planned activity is to drill the intermediate 12 1/4"" hole from 06:00 to 06:30 for 0.5 hours. This phase is intermediate drilling with the code Trips. The operation is a pre-job safety meeting (PJSM) with FORGE DSM's and Frontier Drilling.

The next operation is a trip out of the hole (TOOH) with BHA #2. They will break off the bit and lay down Scout RSS (rotary steerable). This will take place from 06:30 to 08:30 for 2.0 hours. Again, this is an intermediate drilling phase with the code Trips. The operation is to pick up Conventional BHA #3, which consists of a Smith RK6139 tricone bit, 9 5/8"" Scout 7/8 5.9 stage fixed motor stabilized to 12 1/8"", 8"" shock sub, 4 stands of 8"" drill collars, 6 5/8"" X 4 1/2"" IF x-over, and 3 stands of HW drill pipe.

They will then trip in the hole (TIH) and tag up on the shoe track at 1,605'. This will occur from 08:30 to 09:00 for 0.5 hours. The phase is still intermediate drilling with the code Drilling. The operation is to drill cement in the shoe track from 1,605' to 1,627', and then drill the shoe from 1,627' to 1,629'. They will also drill 15' of new formation to a depth of 1,644'.

From 09:00 to 09:30 for 0.5 hours, the phase is intermediate drilling with the code Other. The operation is to perform a FIT (formation integrity test) at 1,644' MD to equivalent mud weight (emw) of 9.5 pounds per gallon (ppg).

From 09:30 to 11:00 for 1.5 hours, the phase is still intermediate drilling with the code Trips. The operation is another TOOH, this time with BHA #3. They will break off the bit and lay it down.

- 12K WOB, 157.8 fph, 205 psi diff, 660 gpm, 46 rpm 
- 15K WOB (bit balled). The step test is stopped at this point.

From 17:00 to 18:00 for 1.0 hour, the phase is intermediate drilling with the code Drilling. The operation is to clean the bit and continue drilling from 2,030' to 2,100', at a rate of 70 fph.

From 18:00 to 04:00 for 10.0 hours, the phase is intermediate drilling with the code Drilling. The operation is another pre-job safety meeting (PJSM) with FORGE DSM's and Frontier Drilling. They will drill from 2,100' to 2,575', with an average rate of 59.4 fph. The weight on bit (WOB) will be between 8-14 K, the rate of rotation (ROT) will be 40, the torque (TQ) will be between 1,700 - 2,200 ft lbs, the standpipe pressure (SPP) will be 1700 psi, and the differential pressure (DIFF) will be 80 - 200 psi. They will pump sweeps as needed to prevent bit balling.

From 04:00 to 06:00 for 2.0 hours, the phase is intermediate drilling, and the code is not available. The operation is to drill from 2,575' to 2,630', with an average rate of 27.5 fph. The WOB will be between 8-14 K, the ROT will be 40 - 50, the TQ will be between 1,900 - 2,600 ft lbs, with occasional spikes up to 4,000 ft-lbs. The SPP will be between 1700 - 1800 psi, and the DIFF will be between 100 - 300 psi.

The last survey was taken at 2,466', with an inclination of 0.92 and an azimuth of 74.99. They are adjusting the drilling parameters to increase the rate of penetration (ROP), while maintaining an inclination of less than 2 degrees. There is a slight lithologic change at 2,575', with fewer interstitial clays and occasional rock fragments coming to the surface."

The current operation is drilling the 12.25"" Intermediate Hole at an elevation of 5415.1 on the drill floor square of 7.0. The directional drilling is 17 and the measured depth is not available.

The planned activity for today is to drill the 12.25"" hole, fuel, casing, and beads to be delivered. This will take place from 06:00 to 18:00, for a total of 12.0 hours. The phase of this operation is Intermediate Drilling, and the code is Drilling. There will be a pre-job safety meeting (PJSM) with FORGE DSM's and Frontier Drilling.

We will drill ahead with BHA #4 from 2,630' - 3,260', a distance of 630' at a rate of 52.5 FPH. The WOB (Weight on Bit) will be between 30-35 K, with a rotation speed of 77 rpm, torque of 4,400 ft lbs, SPP (Standpipe Pressure) between 2,000-2,200 psi, and a differential pressure of 160 psi. The last survey was conducted at 3,125, with an inclination of 1.54 and azimuth of 64.06. We will control the drilling to drop the angle.

At 2,905', we will increase the WOB from 35K to 40K. However, we noticed that our penetration rate dropped to lower levels and became more uneven. A function test will be conducted on the pipe rams from 18:00 to 19:30, for a duration of 1.5 hours. The phase for this operation is Coring, and the code is Intermediate Drilling. Another pre-job safety meeting (PJSM) will be held with FORGE DSM's and Frontier Drilling.

We will continue drilling ahead with BHA #4 from 3,260'-3,323', a distance of 42', at a rate of 42.0 FPH. The WOB will be 35K, with a rotation speed of 75 rpm, flow rate of 795 gpm, torque of 4,400 ft lbs, SPP between 2,000-2,200 psi, and a differential pressure of 170 psi. The last survey was conducted at 3,323, with an inclination of 1.58 and azimuth of 19.15. We will control the drilling to drop the angle.

At 3,323, we will decrease the WOB from 40K to 35K. The penetration rate is approximately the same. We will continue drilling ahead with BHA #4 from 3,323'-3,418', a distance of 95', at a rate of 38 FPH. The WOB will be between 33-35K, with a rotation speed of 75 rpm, flow rate of 725 gpm, torque of 4,200 ft lbs, SPP between 2,000-2,200 psi, and a differential pressure of 170 psi. The last survey was conducted at 3,418, with an inclination of 1.05 and azimuth of 332.83. We will control the drilling to drop the angle. Additionally, we will decrease the flow rate from 795 to 725 gpm, resulting in a drop in the penetration rate to 38 FPH.

From 22:00 to 00:00, we will install a camera on the derrick to monitor Top Drive Connections. This operation will last for 2.0 hours. The phase is Intermediate Drilling, and the code is Drilling.

The current operation was drilling ahead at an elevation of 5415.1. The drill floor square was 8.0, and the directional drilling was at 18. The measured depth was not specified. The planned activity was to trip out of the hole and then trip back into the hole. This would be followed by starting the drilling process from 06:00 to 11:00 for a total of 5.0 hours. This phase was considered intermediate drilling, and the corresponding code was ""Drilling"". The operation included a pre-job safety meeting (PJSM) involving the FORGE DSM's and Frontier Drilling.

During this process, the drilling would proceed with BHA #4 from 3,984' to 4,187', a distance of 203' at a rate of 40.6 FPH. The weight on bit (WOB) would range from 30-35 K, with a rotation speed (ROT) of 40 rpm. The gallons per minute (gpm) would be 660, the torque (TQ) would be 4,459 ft lbs, and the surface pump pressure (SPP) would range from 2,100 to 2,250 psi. The differential pressure (DIFF) would be 285 psi.

The last survey was conducted at 4,069 with an inclination (Inc) of 1.23 and an azimuth (AZM) of 315.63. The drilling would be controlled to drop the angle. From 11:00 to 15:00, for a total of 4.0 hours, the phase would still be intermediate drilling with the same code (Drilling). The operation would continue to drill ahead with BHA #4, this time from 4,187' to 4,258', a distance of 71' at a rate of 17.75' FPH. The WOB would range from 35-40 K, with a ROT of 40 rpm. The gpm would be 730, the TQ would be 4,287 ft lbs, and the SPP would range from 2,150 to 2,250 psi. The DIFF would range from 225 to 260 psi.

The last survey at this stage was conducted at 4,258 with an Inc of 0.092 and an AZM of 210.05. The lithology at 4,250 consisted of 65% clay and clay stone, and 35% fine sand from granite. The clay was reddish-brown, soft, moderately soluble, and kaolinitic, with a sandy texture. The sand was fine to medium granular and angular to subangular, also sourced from granite.

From 15:00 to 18:00, for a total of 3.0 hours, the phase remained intermediate drilling with the same code (Drilling). At 15:00, the rig experienced a power loss, but power was restored at 15:10. The drilling would continue ahead with BHA #4 from 4,258' to 4,327', a distance of 69' at a rate of 23' FPH. The WOB would range from 35-40 K, with a ROT of 40 rpm. The gpm would be 730, the TQ would be 4,420 ft lbs, and the SPP would range from 2,150 to 2,250 psi. The DIFF would be 223 psi. 

The last survey at this stage was conducted at 4,164 with an Inc of 0.92 and an AZM of 263.33. At 4,300, the lithology consisted of 65% sand, which was fine to medium grain, angular to subangular, sourced from granite. The remaining 35% consisted of clay and clay stone, described as white to light reddish-brown, soft, moderately soluble, and kaolinitic, with a sandy texture.

From 18:00 to 00:00, for a total of 6.0 hours, the phase remained intermediate drilling, but the code was not specified (nan). The operation included another pre-job safety meeting (PJSM) involving the FORGE DSM's and Frontier Drilling. The drilling would proceed with BHA #4 from 4,327' to 4,460', a distance of 133' at a rate of 22.2 FPH. The WOB would range from 40-48 K, with a ROT of 55-65 rpm. The gpm would range from 730 to 850, the TQ would be 4,6000 ft lbs, and the SPP would range from 2,700 to 2,800 psi. The DIFF would be 223 psi.

The last survey at this stage was conducted at 4,457 with an Inc of 1.14 and an AZM of 155.47. The lithology at 4,460 consisted of granite/granodiorite, med dark grey, with a soft to moderately firm texture.

The current operation was to repair Pump 2, with an elevation of 5415.1 and a drill floor square of 12.0. The directional drilling was at 22, but the measured depth was not available. The planned activity was to finish repairs to Pump 2, including TIH (tripped in hole), dropped gyro, and TOOH (tripped out of hole) with a survey tool. In addition, they were planning to run casing and perform various tasks from 06:00 to 15:00 for a total of 9.0 hours. This phase of the operation was considered intermediate drilling, with the drilling code set as ""Drilling."" They also had a pre-job safety meeting (PJSM) with FORGE DSM's and Frontier Drilling.

They proceeded to drill ahead using BHA #6 from depths of 5,042 to 5,113, totaling 71 feet, at a rate of 7.8 feet per hour. The parameters for this drilling included a WOB (weight on bit) of 50-60K, a ROT (rate of turn) of 45 rpm, a flow rate of 800 gallons per minute (gpm), a TQ (torque) of 3,350 - 3,500 ft lbs, an SPP (surface pumping pressure) of 2,400 - 2,800 psi, and a DIFF (differential pressure) of 125 -170 psi. The last survey was conducted at 4,920 feet, with an inclination of 1.27 and an azimuth of 159.42.

The lithology of the drilling site was described as rhyolite, which was light grey to white in color. It was crypto-crystalline and mainly composed of quartz and feldspar, with a small percentage of black-brown biotite.

Unfortunately, Frontier mud pump number 2 experienced a malfunction and needed to be repaired. The drilling was paused to pick up the equipment off the bottom and investigate the issue. It was discovered that the middle module had suffered wash out damages that were beyond repair. This phase of the operation lasted from 15:00 to 19:00, totaling 4.0 hours. The code for this phase was ""Trips,"" and the operation involved preparing to trip out of the hole and pumping 20 barrels of pill (a special fluid) into the well.

From 19:00 to 21:30, which lasted 2.5 hours, the team continued with the ""Trips"" phase. They laid down the directional tools, broke out the bit, and found that it had minimal damage. From 21:30 to 04:00, which lasted 6.5 hours, they made up BHA 7 and performed various tasks such as running the gyro BHA, TIH with a re-run bit, and adding a bit sub with a float and crows foot for the gyro dart. They then proceeded to trip in the hole and laid down nine 8"" drill collars.

Next, they performed another trip in the hole, this time with BHA 7, until they reached the casing shoe at a depth of 1,629 feet. Once there, they made up stands of drill pipe to replace the BHA that was laid down earlier. The operations were then shut down, and the team had to wait for pump repairs. From 04:00 to 06:00, lasting 2.0 hours, Frontier personnel worked on replacing pump 2, module 2."

The current operation involves drilling ahead with BHA #9 at a measured depth of 5200' and true vertical depth of 5199'. The last survey was conducted at 5092' with an inclination of 1.56° and an azimuth of 108.18°. The elevation is at 5415.1 on the drill floor square measuring 16.0. The directional drilling angle is 26.

The planned activity is to continue drilling the production hole with BHA #9 from 06:00 to 11:00, lasting for 5.0 hours. This phase is classified as production drilling with the code Test B.O.P. The operation during this time is PJSM, which stands for pre-job safety meeting. 

During this period, various tests were conducted including a test on the blowout preventer (BOPE) with a pressure range from 250 psi low to 5000 psi high. The casing was also tested at 1500 psi, as well as the choke manifold at 5000 psi. 

From 11:00 to 11:30, there was a phase change to trips. The operation during this time was to install a wear bushing. 

From 11:30 to 17:30, there was another phase change, but this time the operation was classified as other. There was a PJSM conducted for safety purposes. Then, the BHA #8, which includes an 8 3/4"" mill tooth bit, was picked up. The procedure included tripping in the hole to 3,000' and circulating two bottoms up to cool off the hole. After that, they tripped in the hole to 4,800' and started circulation. Additionally, a precautionary trip was made in the hole to make connections for temperature control at the motor, and the float collar was tagged. The next step was to drill out the float collar, cement, and float shoe, followed by circulating two bottoms up.

From 17:30 to 18:00, there was another phase change to trips. Again, there was a PJSM for safety. The operation during this phase was to trip out of the hole to change out the BHA. 

From 18:00 to 20:00, there was a 2.0-hour phase of trips, which included another PJSM. During this time, the BHA #8 was laid down. 

From 20:00 to 20:30, there was a 0.5-hour phase classified as other. The operation consisted of breaking off the saver sub on top drive and installing a corrosion ring. 

From 20:30 to 00:00, there was a 3.5-hour phase for directional work. The operation during this time was to pick up BHA #9, which consists of Smith XS616, Vertical Scout RSS, 6 1/2"" Scout 7/8 3.0 fixed motor, 6 1/2"" NOV shock sub, 6 3/4"" Stabil Drill NM Stabilizer, 6 1/2"" Scout UBHO, 6 3/4"" NMDC, 7 stands of 6 1/2"" DC's, and 3 stands of weight pipe.

From 00:00 to 02:00, there was a 2.0-hour phase of trips, and the operation was to trip in the hole with drill pipe to 3,000' and circulate bottoms up to cool the hole. After that, they tripped in the hole with drill pipe to 4,930' and started circulation. 

From 02:00 to 04:00, there was a 2.0-hour phase classified as other. The operation during this time was to ream the float collar and shoe track and drill out of the shoe. Additionally, 12' of new formation was drilled, and a FIT (formation integrity test) was performed to achieve 9.6 ppg EMW.

From 04:00 to 06:00, there was a 2.0-hour phase classified as drilling. The operation during this time was to drill ahead from 5,113' to 5200' with BHA #9, using a weight on bit (WOB) of 38K, a rotary speed of 31 rpm, a differential pressure of 275 psi, and a flow rate of 485 gpm. The last survey was conducted at 5,092' with an inclination of 1.56° and an azimuth of 108.18°. A step test was conducted in 5-minute increments. The WOB varied, with the corresponding footage per hour (FPH) as follows:

The current activity was focused on building the curve section at a measured depth (MD) of 6,016'. The previous survey was conducted at a MD of 5,898', with an inclination (INC) of 2.31° and an azimuth (AZI) of 102.95°. The elevation at the drill floor square was 5415.1. 

The planned activity was to continue building the curve, aiming for a 65° angle. This operation was scheduled to take place from 06:00 to 09:00 for a duration of 3.0 hours. The phase of this operation was identified as Production Drilling, while the corresponding code was Drilling. Specifically, the operation involved drilling the core from 5,878' to 5,892', with 14' progress at a rate of 4.67 feet per hour (fph). The drilling parameters utilized were 6,000 pounds per square inch (psi) weight on bit (wob), 40 revolutions per minute (rpm) rotary speed, and a flow rate of 347 gallons per minute (gpm).

Following this, from 09:00 to 13:30 for a duration of 4.5 hours, the operation shifted to Trips under the Production Drilling phase. The task at hand was to trip out of the hole using BHA #17 core assembly and lay down the core barrels. Coring was performed from 5,858' to 5,892', resulting in the retrieval of 31' of core.

Subsequently, from 13:30 to 14:30 for 1.0 hour, the operation transitioned to Trips under Production Drilling to lay down 18 - 6 1/2"" drill collars. This was followed by a Rig Service operation from 14:30 to 15:30 for 1.0 hour, involving the servicing of the rig and top drive.

From 15:30 to 19:00 for a duration of 3.5 hours, the operation fell under the Other category in the Production Drilling phase. The task was to rig up Extreme Wireline equipment and notify the personnel from the University of Utah before running it into the hole. The wireline was run to a depth of 5,750' with a string shot measuring 10' in length and containing 800 grains of primer cord. The shot was initiated at 16:42:30. Upon pulling the string shot to the surface, the primer cord was removed, and the shot detonated, resulting in the rig being shut down.

After rigging up the wireline for a second shot, the operation continued from 19:00 to 03:00 for a duration of 8.0 hours. This activity once again fell under the Trips category in the Production Drilling phase. The objective was to pick up BHA #18 (Curve assembly) comprising of various components such as a Reed TKC63 PDC bit, 6 1/2"" Scout 7/8 5.7 stage 1.5° fixed motor, 6 1/2"" Scout string sub with a PUK sensor, 6 3/4"" NM pony collar, 6 1/2"" NM UBHO sub, 6 3/4"" NMDC with MWD tool, 2 - 6 3/4"" NMDC's, 6 - 6 1/2"" drill collars, and 45 joints of 5"" HWDP. During the trip in the hole, six axis points were recorded for correlation purposes.

From 03:00 to 06:00 for 3.0 hours, the phase and code for the operation were not specified. The task involved drilling from 5,892' to 5,894' and orienting the tool face to begin building the curve.

The survey results at this point indicated the following: MD of 5898', INC of 2.31°, AZM of 102.95°, TVD of 5896.81', VS of 21.77', and DLS of 0.38.

The current operation was to trip out of the hole and lay down the reamer BHA 40. The elevation was at 5415.1, and the drill floor square was 47.0. The directional drilling measurement was 57, and the measured depth was 9748.0.

The planned activity was to complete laying down the reamer BHA, test the BOP, and run in the hole with the directional BHA 41. This was scheduled from 06:00 to 01:30, with a total duration of 19.5 hours. The phase of the operation was production drilling, and the code was reaming. Before starting, a pre-job safety meeting (PJSM) was conducted with Frontier and DSM.

During the reaming process, the target was to ream from 8,083' to 9,748'', with a recommended RPM range of 55-70. The pumping flow rate was set at 625 GPM, and the desired rate of penetration was 80-120 FPH. TORKease sweeps were used as needed for lubricity. Two batches of 40bbl high viscosity TORKease sweeps were pumped at 9,600' and 9,690' while reaming. The mud weight was 9.2 PPG, and the viscosity was 70. The shakers received a high volume of cuttings during this process.

After completing the reaming, the next step was to build a dry job and prepare for tripping out of the hole. This phase took place from 01:30 to 06:00, with a duration of 4.5 hours. The phase was still production drilling, but the code now changed to trips. The operation involved tripping out of the hole with BHA #40 and laying down the reamer assembly.

The current operation at hand was to trip in the hole with a directional BHA #42, with an elevation of 5415.1 on the drill floor square measuring 49.0. The directional drilling angle was 59 and the measured depth reached 10490.0.

The planned activity for this phase was to finish tripping in the hole and proceed to drill to the total depth (TD) from 06:00 to 09:00, lasting for 3.0 hours. The designated phase for this activity was production drilling, coded as drilling. The operation included drilling and rotating while sliding from 9,961' to 10,097' (136') at a rate of 45.3 feet per hour (FPH), with a weight on bit (WOB) of 40K, a speed of 55 RPM, and a flow rate of 645 gallons per minute (GPM).

From 09:00 to 09:30, lasting for 0.5 hours, the phase shifted to rig service, with the specific code for this operation being rig service. The task at hand during this period was to repair a gasket in the mud line to the pumps.

The following period, from 09:30 to 18:30, lasting for a total of 9.0 hours, returned to the production drilling phase, coded as drilling. The operation included drilling and rotating while sliding from 10,097' to 10,490' (393') at a rate of 43.7 FPH, with a WOB of 40K, a speed of 55 RPM, and a flow rate of 645 GPM. During this process, the rotation covered a distance of 316' (5.8 hours) with an average rate of penetration (ROP) of 54.5 FPH. The sliding covered a distance of 77' (2.61 hours) with an average ROP of 29.6 FPH. Additionally, repairs, connections, and positioning of the tool face took 0.6 hours to complete. The pressure was increased, resulting in rubber coming across the shaker.

The survey measurements taken at this point were as follows: measured depth (MD) of 10411', inclination (INC) of 64.68°, azimuth (AZM) of 105.97°, true vertical depth (TVD) of 8351.45', vertical section (VS) of 3535.30', and dogleg severity (DLS) of 2.63. Furthermore, the target was positioned 4' below and 16.0' to the right.

From 18:30 to 19:00, lasting for 0.5 hours, the phase changed to conditional mud and circulation, with the operation involving the building of a dry pill and setting up for the upcoming trip out of the hole.

From 19:00 to 00:30, lasting for 5.5 hours, the phase shifted to trips, with the code for this operation being trips. The task at hand was to trip out of the hole with BHA #41.

From 00:30 to 01:30, lasting for 1.0 hour, the phase changed again to production drilling, specifically directed work. The operation during this period involved laying down the VibraScout due to a stator failure. Additionally, the bit was broken out and the motor, along with the BHA #41, was laid down.

From 01:30 to 02:00, lasting for 0.5 hours, the phase remained as production drilling, directed work. The task at hand was to make up the directional BHA #42.

From 02:00 to 03:30, lasting for 1.5 hours, the phase shifted back to trips as the operation involved tripping in the hole to a depth of 5,256' while picking up the VibraScout.

From 03:30 to 06:00, lasting for 2.5 hours, the phase remained as production drilling, with the code being cut off drill line. The operation at this point was to slip and cut the drill line, while also circulating to monitor the temperature."

Seven point one feet of core was retrieved","On December 23, 2020, the drilling operation took place at Well Name FORGE 16A [78]-32 under the supervision of three rig supervisors: Duane W, Leroy S, and Paul S. The purpose of the operation was to clean the bottom of the hole, trip out of the hole, pick up the coring assembly, trip back into the hole, and cut the core. The activity started at 06:00 and lasted until 07:30, totaling 1.5 hours.

During this phase, the code for the production drilling was trips, and the operation involved tripping into the hole with coring BHA #47 to a depth of 5,139'. Additionally, pipe fill was performed. The next phase, from 07:30 to 08:00, lasted for 0.5 hours and involved tripping out of the hole from 5,139' to 7,997'. In the following phase, from 08:00 to 08:30, another 0.5-hour operation took place, which included circulating for temperature.

The operation continued with several more phases, each lasting for 0.5 hours. These included tripping in the hole from 7,997' to 9,500', followed by another circulation for temperature. The next trip in the hole went from 9,500' to 10,169'. The subsequent 0.5-hour operation involved obtaining baseline string weights and rotary torque, as well as a precautionary wash from 10,169' to 10,742'. 

The next phase, from 10:30 to 11:00, involved obtaining string weights and rotary torque, as well as another precautionary wash from 10,742' to 10,950'. From 11:00 to 12:00, the operation included obtaining final string weights and rotary torque at 10,950', tagging the bottom at 10,955', and circulating bottoms up at 450 gpm and 40-50 rpm. 

From 12:00 to 12:30, the focus shifted to coring operations. A ball was dropped and pumped down at 100 gpm, followed by landing the ball. This phase lasted for 0.5 hours. The following significant phase lasted from 12:30 to 17:00, totaling 4.5 hours. It involved coring from 10,955' to 10,971' at a weight on bit (WOB) of 8K, a rotation per minute (RPM) of 40, and a rate of 350-375 gpm. A total of 16' of core was cored, with an average rate of 3.5 feet per hour. However, the coring had to be stopped due to a low penetration rate.

From 17:00 to 17:30, a temperature circulation was performed to facilitate the building of a dry job. This phase lasted for 0.5 hours. The subsequent phase, from 17:30 to 23:00, was the longest, lasting for 5.5 hours. It involved pulling 5 stands off the bottom and pumping a dry job. Finally, a trip out of the hole with coring BHA #47 took place. 

From 23:00 to 00:00, the operation transitioned back to coring operations. The core barrel was broken down, and a total of 16' of core was retrieved, out of which 7.1' was recovered. The next phase, from 00:00 to 03:00, involved picking up the clean-out BHA #48 and tripping back into the hole to a depth of 5,222'. 

The following phases, from 03:00 to 03:30 and from 03:30 to 04:30, involved circulating for temperature and tripping in the hole from 5,222' to 8,001', respectively. These were followed by another circulation for temperature from 04:30 to 05:00 and a trip in the hole from 8,001' to 9,492' from 05:00 to 05:30. Finally, from 05:30 to 06:00, a 0.5-hour phase of circulation for temperature was carried out."

11. For","On December 30, 2020, the well named ""FORGE 16A [78]-32"" was being supervised by Leroy S, Paul S, Bob F, and Duane W. The current operation involved washing the casing from an elevation of 10,633' to 10,787', with a drill floor square of 61.0 and a directional drilling angle of 71. The measured depth was 10,987.0.

The planned activity for the day was to pump a high viscosity sweep and spot 5% lube in the tangent. After that, they would trip out to run the liner from 06:00 to 07:00 for 1.0 hour. This phase was under the production drilling code ""Trips"". Their operation during this time would be to pick up 15 joints of rental drill pipe for running the liner.

The next phase, also under the ""Trips"" code, was scheduled from 07:00 to 08:30 for 1.5 hours. It involved tripping out of the hole with 5 stands of rental drill pipe and racking it in the derrick. 

From 08:30 to 09:00, there would be a half-hour phase under the production drilling code ""Rig Service"". During this time, the operation would be to service the rig and top drive.

The subsequent phase, from 09:00 to 10:00, was planned for 1.0 hour under the production drilling code ""Trips"". The operation would be to trip in the hole from 5,151' to 8,000'.

From 10:00 to 10:30, there would be a half-hour phase under the production drilling code ""Cond Mud & Circ"". The operation during this time would be to circulate for temperature.

The next phase, scheduled from 10:30 to 11:30 for 1.0 hour, would also be under the production drilling code ""Trips"". The operation would involve tripping in the hole from 8,000' to 10,987'. They would tag bottom and pull back 1 stand and a single to 10,864'.

From 11:30 to 12:00, there would be a half-hour phase under the production drilling code ""Cond Mud & Circ"". The operation would be to spot a 50 bbl slug of sand (1.9 lb/gal, 4,000 lb) at 10,864' with a viscosity of 60.

They would chase it with 168 bbl of mud to balance the well from 12:00 to 12:30, which was a half-hour phase under the production drilling code ""nan"".

From 12:30 to 14:00, there would be a 1.5-hour phase under the production drilling code ""Cond Mud & Circ"". The operation during this time would be to mix an additional 50 bbl slug of sand with a viscosity of 80.

From 14:00 to 14:30, there would be a half-hour phase under the production drilling code ""Trips"". The operation would involve tripping in the hole with 4 stands to 10,496'.

From 14:30 to 15:00, there would be another half-hour phase under the production drilling code ""Cond Mud & Circ"". The operation would be to spot a 50 bbl slug of sand (1.9 lb/gal, 4,000 lb) at 10,496' with a viscosity of 80.

They would chase it with 160 bbl of mud to balance the well from 15:00 to 19:00, which was a 4.0-hour phase under the production drilling code ""Trips"".

From 19:00 to 00:30, there would be a 5.5-hour phase under the production drilling code ""Trips"". The operation would be to trip in the hole to 10,000' with a clean out BHA #54 and lay down the orange peel stinger pipe.

From 00:30 to 02:00, there would be a 1.5-hour phase under the production drilling code ""Cond Mud & Circ"". The operation during this time would be to air out the pumps and break down the foam with a de-foamer.

From 02:00 to 06:00, there would be a 4.0-hour phase under the production drilling code ""Reaming"". The operation would involve washing from 10,000' to 10,633'.

To conclude, they would pump a 20 bbl, 50 viscosity sweep at 10,633' and circulate out the sweep without any sand."
