This falls under the production drilling code and is categorized as \"cond mud & circ.\"\\n\\nFrom 20:00 to 22:30 for 2.5 hours, there will be a trip out of the hole with the BHA #16. The BHA will then be laid down.\\n\\nBetween 22:30 and 02:30 for 4.0 hours, another trip will be made to make up the coring BHA #17 with CCI 713 core bit and trip in the hole. The last 2 stands will be washed to the bottom and the bottom of the hole will be circulated.\\n\\nFrom 02:30 to 06:00 for 3.5 hours, coring will take place from 5,858\\' to 5,878\\' with a depth of 20\\' at a rate of 5.7 feet per hour (fph).
